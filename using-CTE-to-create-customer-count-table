This SQL query will demonstrate use of a common table expression (CTE) as part of a larger query to produce a table 
listing the number of customers and top 5 highest-paying lifetime customers each country has.

-- create the table of the top 5 highest-paying lifetime customers using a CTE for use in a JOIN
WITH top_5_customers (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, total_amount_paid) AS
    (SELECT customer.customer_id AS customer_id,
        customer.first_name AS first_name,
        customer.last_name AS last_name,
        country.country AS country,
        city.city AS city,
        SUM(payment.amount) AS total_amount_paid
      FROM customer
      INNER JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
      INNER JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
      INNER JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
      INNER JOIN payment ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
      WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule (Dhulia)',
                        'Kurashiki', 'Pinxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'Nezahualcyotl')
      GROUP BY customer.customer_id, country, city
      ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
      LIMIT 5)
-- create the table of countries with their total counts of all customers and top 5 highest-paying lifetime customers.
SELECT country.country AS country,
          COUNT(DISTINCT customer.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
          COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer
INNER JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
INNER JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
INNER JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
-- use a JOIN to integrate the table created using a CTE
LEFT JOIN top_5_customers ON country.country = top_5_customers.country
