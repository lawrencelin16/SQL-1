# cf-rockbuster-sql
Repository for the CF Rockbuster course project and its SQL queries

This repository contains SQL queries written for a course project named Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project. The SQL queries for this project were used to retrieve, organize, and analyze data in order to answer business questions for how the movie rental company, Rockbuster Stealth, can best craft a launch strategy for its new  online video rental service. 
The key business questions are:
* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
* What was the average rental duration for all videos?
* What movie genres generated the highest revenue?
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

The dataset used for this project contains information about Rockbuster's film catalog, customers, and transactions. It can be found [here](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip). 

The dataset was loaded into a PostgreSQL database for use with SQL during this project.

The analysis conducted on this dataset using SQL was used to produce Tableau visualizations that can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/CFExercise3_10Viz/Top10CountriesbyCustomers?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
